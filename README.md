TAME is Totally A Markdown Editor!

# Introduction
Hi, there!
You've discovered _TAME_,the most docile markdown editor on the web. 
I created this because I was frustrated with all the other options out there.
These were either:

1. Far too memory intensive, or
2. Proprietary and didn't allow me to **easily** access my own work.

You won't find anything fancy in this domesticated environment, but you will be able to edit whatever you like.
_And_, we won't steal your data; It's all yours!
(Just make sure to back it up...)
